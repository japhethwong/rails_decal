PROJECT 1 QUESTIONS
===================

Question 0: Why is this error being thrown?

This error is being thrown because we have not created a Pokemon model yet.

Question 1: How are the random Pokemon appearing? What is the common factor between all the possible Pokemon that appear?

In HomeController's index method, we query for all Pokemon which do not have a trainer assigned to them (aka a 'wild Pokemon').  We then randomly sample from these Pokemon as @pokemon, which is then displayed in the associated view.  The common attribute between these Pokemon is that they do not have a trainer assigned to them.
 
Question 2a: What does the following line in the help text do? Be specific about what "capture_path(id: @pokemon)" is doing. If you're having trouble, look at the Help section in the README.

The specified line is sets the button's action.  When the button is pressed, a request will be made to the URI pattern which matches the prefix "capture", and binds the Pokemon instance in the view to id as part of the request.  In our controller, this gives us access to the appropriate Pokemon ID in our params hashmap.
 
Question 3: What would you name your own Pokemon?


 
Question 4: What did you pass into the redirect_to? If it is a path, what did that path need? If it is not a path, why is it okay not to have a path here?

 
Question 5: Explain how putting this line "flash[:error] = @pokemon.errors.full_messages.to_sentence" shows error messages on your form.
